4 for read 2 for write  1 execute in chmod

and 7 for all read write and execute.

Ex:
In chmod 644, the digits represent permissions as follows:

First digit (6):
Binary equivalent: 110
Permissions for the owner: Read (r) and Write (w) - The owner can view and modify the file content.
Second digit (4):
Binary equivalent: 100
Permissions for the group: Read (r) only - The group members can only view the file content, not modify it.
Third digit (4):
Binary equivalent: 100
Permissions for others: Read (r) only - Everyone else on the system can only view the file content, not modify it.

ps -ef to check all the process.
